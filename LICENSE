This project was created by following the React course from Code with Mosh
(https://codewithmosh.com/) by Mosh Hamedani. The core architecture and
foundational code patterns are derived from that course material. All code
was written by Glen Jarvis as a learning exercise, and subsequent modifications
and enhancements are my own work.
